# Roll-A-Ball

This is my first game with Unity.
In this first approach I have worked with the default unity assets. I've just practiced with the basic physics and movements.

I have also created some green collectibles that add points per level. When you reach 8 points you go to the next level. There are some red obstacles that subtract points but the game is made to win easily.
